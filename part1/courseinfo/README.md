# Course Info App

使用 React + Vite

```bash
# npm 7+, in directory "part1"
npm create vite@latest courseinfo -- --template react
cd courseinfo
npm install
npm run dev
```

Note: Only submitted the final results after 1.5

## 1.1: Course Information, step 1

Use Vite to initialize a new application. Modify main.jsx to match the following

```jsx
import { StrictMode } from 'react'
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
import App from './App.jsx'

createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <App />
  </StrictMode>,
)
```

and App.jsx to match the following

```jsx
function App() {
  const course = 'Half Stack application development'
  const part1 = 'Fundamentals of React'
  const exercises1 = 10
  const part2 = 'Using props to pass data'
  const exercises2 = 7
  const part3 = 'State of a component'
  const exercises3 = 14

  return (
    <>
      <div>
        <h1>{course}</h1>
        <p>
          {part1} {exercises1}
        </p>
        <p>
          {part2} {exercises2}
        </p>
        <p>
          {part3} {exercises3}
        </p>
        <p>Number of exercises {exercises1 + exercises2 + exercises3}</p>
      </div>
    </>
  )
}

export default App
```

and remove the extra files App.css and index.css, also remove the directory assets.

Then, Define the new components in the file App.jsx.

Refactor the code so that it consists of three new components: Header, Content, and Total. All data still resides in the App component, which passes the necessary data to each component using props. Header takes care of rendering the name of the course, Content renders the parts and their number of exercises and Total renders the total number of exercises.

The App component's body will approximately be as follows:

```jsx
function App() {
  // const-definitions

  return (
    <div>
      <Header course={course} />
      <Content ... />
      <Total ... />
    </div>
  )
}
```

## 1.2: Course Information, step 2

Refactor the Content component so that it does not render any names of parts or their number of exercises by itself. Instead, it only renders three Part components of which each renders the name and number of exercises of one part.

```jsx
const Content = ... {
  return (
    <div>
      <Part .../>
      <Part .../>
      <Part .../>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## 1.3: Course Information step 3

Modify the variable definitions of the App component as follows and also refactor the application so that it still works:

```jsx
const App = () => {
  const course = 'Half Stack application development'
  const part1 = {
    name: 'Fundamentals of React',
    exercises: 10
  }
  const part2 = {
    name: 'Using props to pass data',
    exercises: 7
  }
  const part3 = {
    name: 'State of a component',
    exercises: 14
  }

  return (
    <div>
      ...
    </div>
  )
}
```

## 1.4: Course Information step 4

Place the objects into an array. Modify the variable definitions of App into the following form and modify the other parts of the application accordingly:

```jsx
const App = () => {
  const course = 'Half Stack application development'
  const parts = [
    {
      name: 'Fundamentals of React',
      exercises: 10
    },
    {
      name: 'Using props to pass data',
      exercises: 7
    },
    {
      name: 'State of a component',
      exercises: 14
    }
  ]

  return (
    <div>
      ...
    </div>
  )
}
```

## 1.5: Course Information step 5

Let's take the changes one step further. Change the course and its parts into a single JavaScript object. Fix everything that breaks.

```jsx
const App = () => {
  const course = {
    name: 'Half Stack application development',
    parts: [
      {
        name: 'Fundamentals of React',
        exercises: 10
      },
      {
        name: 'Using props to pass data',
        exercises: 7
      },
      {
        name: 'State of a component',
        exercises: 14
      }
    ]
  }

  return (
    <div>
      ...
    </div>
  )
}
```
